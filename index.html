    <p data-toggle="tooltip" title="Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
    in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
    to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
    severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
    and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
    discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.">  What is corona virus ? </p>

    <p data-toggle="tooltip" title="COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
    discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
    before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. ">  What is COVID-19 ?  </p>
    <p data-toggle="tooltip" title=" The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
    dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
    congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
    usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
    don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
    (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
    treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
    becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
    and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
    heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
    People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
    attention. "> What are the symptoms of COVID-19 ?   </p>
    <p data-toggle="tooltip" title=" People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
    disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
    the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
    coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
    around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
    these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
    People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
    person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
    why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
    person who is sick.">  How does COVID-19 spread ?  </p>
    <p data-toggle="tooltip" title="Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
    transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
    through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19
    spread?”  ">  Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air  ?  </p>
    <p data-toggle="tooltip" title=" The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
    expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
    from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
    people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
    particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
    possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
    a mild cough and does not feel ill."> Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms  ?   </p>
    <p data-toggle="tooltip" title="The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
    appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
    be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a 
    main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
    COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
    this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
    after using the bathroom and before eating. ">   Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease  ?  </p>
